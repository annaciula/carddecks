# carddecks
This repository includes working and printing materials used to edit and print card decks for the Open Practice Library. It includes the print ready as well as editable files for cards, tuck box and leaflet insert. The files are organized in the directories working_files and print_ready_files. If you simply want to print the decks, please use the versions in print_ready_files in contact with your printer - these Adobe Illustrator files have been prepared for printing with the text converted to outlines. If you want to edit the files it is better to use the copies in working_files, where the Adobe Illustrator files have editable text.
